**What this project is:** a Clockify-like time-tracking web app branded **TIMESHEET** (Hubble Engineering),
vanilla HTML/CSS/JS on a Supabase backend, deployed to GitHub Pages. The built app is the foundation for a
larger **Workforce Management System (WMS)** — admin-seeded auth, leave/holiday, employee DB, expense/travel,
evaluation, and automated documentation — with modules built progressively against the roadmap.

## 🔴 Next Session — First Priority

> **⏱ UPDATED 2026-07-13 (R62) — supersedes the block below.** **A4 (the pre-launch audit) is live and mid-run, user-driven:** **1A/1B/1C/1D done against real prod** (anon 61/61, client 41/41, member 5/5, manager scoping+bounce pass). Along the way, 1C/Phase-2 surfaced a real gap (Team page showed members the whole org) → built, shipped, and fully re-verified as **R61 Team-visibility scoping** (`20260713`/`20260713b`; RLS-enforced; all 4 re-audit legs green) — **✅ confirmed merged to `main` and live** (2026-07-13 — `app-init.js` on `main` reads `v=125`; corrects the "pending go-ahead" language that had been sitting in the docs). **This round (R62, docs+scripts only):** brought the remaining-phase audit materials current with R61's schema changes before anyone runs them live — Phase 1F gained the new `profiles_select`/helper-fn/trigger-fix SQL, Phase 2 gained an entirely new **2I · Team & Projects** subsection (had zero prior coverage), Phase 3 gained a `project_assignments` orphan check. **▶ Next priority: 🧑/🌐 runs the remaining phases** — 1E (`edge_probe.ps1`) → 1F/1G/1H/3 (Studio SQL, now current) → Phase 2 (browser, now incl. 2I) → Phase 4 (UI/UX + CSP console check) — **requires a human with real network access or Supabase Studio**, still cannot run from this container (403 confirmed again this round). Full detail: [FULL_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](FULL_EXECUTION_PLAN.md) A4 · [PRE_LAUNCH_AUDIT_EXECUTION_PACKET.md](PRE_LAUNCH_AUDIT_EXECUTION_PACKET.md). **Also this session:** Track A's **A6** (closeout content — template wording + leave-policy decision) moved to Track B as **B10**, at the user's direction — it no longer gates A7/A8. **And: B1 (Timesheet → Central Hub) flagged 🔴 open** — the user's real billing process (hours × rate + expenses → invoice, no overtime) doesn't match B1's attendance/payroll scoping, and the core billing math turns out to already work today via Reports, independent of B1. **Deferred to the CEO — A7's agenda now formally includes a full Track B roadmap review**, not just functional/UX feedback on the shipped app. See B1's section in `FULL_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` for the full writeup. *(Block below kept for history; its framing is obsolete.)*

> **⏱ UPDATED 2026-07-10 (R60 cont.) — supersedes the blocks below.** **Track A launch path, current state:** **A0 + A1 done** (R59 — both Studio migrations applied + verified live: client probe 34/34 0 FAIL, 3 lint VERIFY queries 0 rows). **A2 + A3 done** (R60 — 11 audit-doc accuracy corrections + audit coverage extensions: CORS regression block, Part Numbers policy/walkthrough/integrity checks, probe scripts extended to 41 checks). **A5 done** (R60 cont. — Help page refreshed with bilingual Part Numbers/2-tier-leave/Client Portal/Admin Logs content; every factual claim verified against source before commit). **A6.3 done** (R60 cont. — nav-tree/file-structure docs in `HE_interactive_timesheet_plan.md` §7/§10 + `HE_WMS_Specification.md` §14 re-synced against `app.html`'s real 19-route sidebar; **A6.1 template wording + A6.2 leave-policy decision remain open**, both blocked on a 🧑 decision). **Prod serves JS `v=123` / CSS `v=40`** once this batch deploys. **▶ Next priority: A4** — run [PRE_LAUNCH_AUDIT_EXECUTION_PACKET.md](PRE_LAUNCH_AUDIT_EXECUTION_PACKET.md) against prod (targets now current) — **requires a human with real network access or Supabase Studio**, cannot run from this container. The only other launch-path items left (A6.1/A6.2) also need 🧑 input — nothing further is 🤖-doable alone right now. Also open: 🧑 in-browser spot-check of the Help page in prod (A5). Full detail + task-by-task acceptance criteria: [FULL_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](FULL_EXECUTION_PLAN.md). *(Blocks below kept for history; their framing is obsolete.)*

> **⏱ 2026-06-30 (R49).** **Prod serves JS v=113 / CSS v=39** (migrations applied in Studio through `20260708` + `20260629_audit_log.sql` + `20260630_leave_manager_approved.sql`; **Edge Fns: 7**). **✅ F-01 (P0) CLOSED (R49)** — authenticated prod client RLS probe **22/22 PASS**. Root cause of leaks: `get_my_role()` causes a circular RLS dependency inside RESTRICTIVE policies; fixed via new `auth_is_client()` SECURITY DEFINER function + `client_block_*` RESTRICTIVE policies on 11 internal tables (`20260708`, applied). Probe scripts: `f01_prod_client_probe.{sh,ps1}`. **The go-live gate is cleared.** Since R39: R40 full-project audit remediation (`b647cdd` v=99), R44 **F-05/F-08/F-09** (atomic request-review RPCs + select minimization + ESM check), R45 audit-log system + client-logins UX, R46 calendar weekNav, R47 SPEC-M1/2/3 (2-tier leave approval), R48 CONV-M2/M-DSUB/M-SILENT/M-DATE. **▶ Next priority:** **pre-launch audit** ([PRE_LAUNCH_AUDIT_PLAN.md](PRE_LAUNCH_AUDIT_PLAN.md): must-fix CONV-M4 + L-CSP → audit Phases 1–4 → refresh Help page (added 2026-07-09 — `js/pages/help.js` has 0 coverage of everything shipped since R42) → team review) → **roster swap (LAST, RSK-0, 3 confirms).** **⚠️ Pre-launch must-verify:** `20260629_request_review_rpcs.sql` (F-05) apply in prod is UNCONFIRMED while main's code calls those RPCs — if unapplied, approving deletion/name-change/job-title requests fails live (audit Phase 1H). Details in [PENDING_TASKS.md](PENDING_TASKS.md) Round 49. *(Blocks below kept for history; their framing is obsolete.)*

> 📋 **2026-07-09 (R56): [FULL_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](FULL_EXECUTION_PLAN.md) created — the consolidated plan for everything left.** Track A = launch path (A1 apply lint migration → A2/A3 audit-doc fixes + Part-Numbers/CORS coverage → A4 run audit Phases 1–4 → A5 Help-page refresh → A6 closeout → A7 team review → A8 roster swap). Track B = post-launch roadmap (B1 M1 Central Hub, B2 daily Sheets export, B3 audit backlog, B5 BOM, decisions B7). Supersedes the stale status column in the Integrations/Roadmap doc Part 2 and PENDING_TASKS' old "Future roadmap" section. **Start there for sequencing.**
>
> ✅ **2026-07-03 (R53): GitHub account transfer completed.** Both repos (`hubble-wms`, `hubble-wms-backups`) now live under **`SurasakNie`** (Supabase unchanged). Prod: **https://surasaknie.github.io/hubble-wms/**. Google login briefly broke mid-transfer from a case-sensitivity bug in Supabase's Redirect URLs allow-list (fixed same-session) — also fixed a real, pre-existing CSP bug (Google Fonts stylesheet blocked by `style-src`). Full narrative + findings: [REPO_TRANSFER_CHECKLIST.md](REPO_TRANSFER_CHECKLIST.md).
>
> 🚀 **LIVE IN PRODUCTION (2026-06-11, Round 24):** **https://he-cells.github.io/hubble-wms/** — public repo github.com/HE-cells/hubble-wms (app-only; docs/supabase/credentials .gitignored). Deploy = commit + `git push`. Go-live Phases 0–2 done: R23 security hotfix applied + anon probe 43/43 PASS · Pages deploy · prod redirect URLs + Google login verified. R21-07 print margins resolved (0.5in sides, v=82). Sci-fi roster stays through testing; real roster swap is LAST.

**▶ Next session first priority:** 🔨 **LOGIN OVERHAUL (go-live #3)** — backup pipeline (#2) is done (test passed 2026-06-13; see below). The overhaul is the biggest, most sensitive change (RSK-1 — rewrites auth for everyone). **Recommended: plan it first** (no implementation plan exists yet, only the requirements spec in PENDING_TASKS 🔐 section). **Toolchain prerequisites confirmed missing 2026-06-13** (install before building Edge Functions): `supabase` CLI NOT installed (Windows: `scoop install supabase` or direct binary; npm pkg deprecated) · then `supabase login` (personal access token) + `supabase link` project `sjkggguedgtynktymzes` · Deno only needed for local fn testing (cloud provides runtime). Node 24 + npx present. **Dashboard prereq:** flip "Allow manual linking" **ON** (currently OFF) before the Link-Google feature works. Build/test on the sci-fi roster; Google OAuth stays working throughout = rollback path (never locked out).
>
> **Backup pipeline (go-live #2) — ✅ TEST RUN PASSED 2026-06-13 (R26).** Repo **HE-cells/hubble-wms-backups** live *(transferring with the app repo — after transfer, verify the nightly cron is still enabled and re-Watch from the new account; see REPO_TRANSFER_CHECKLIST.md)*; `nightly-db-backup` active (01:00 ICT cron); read-only `backup_role` (+BYPASSRLS so `pg_dump` clears `auth` RLS); secret set; dump `daily/wms_20260613.sql.gz.age` (56 KB) committed; checkout→v6.0.3. **Restore drill Phase 1 ✅** (Claude decrypted + content-verified: 62 tables/COPY, 136 policies, 34 functions, 16 employees + 4 auth.users). **Still before go-live sign-off:** 🔴 restore Phase 2 = clean apply into a scratch Supabase project (deferred — do after the overhaul, near go-live; NOT vanilla local PG) · move `age-key.txt` offline · Watch the repo. *(Storage ❓ resolved: no Supabase Storage — DB dump is complete.)*

**Go-live sequence (revised 2026-06-12, user-confirmed):**
1. ✅ Online on sci-fi roster (Phases 0–2, Round 24)
2. 🟡 **Daily backup pipeline** (above) — ✅ test run passed 2026-06-13; restore drill + age-key offline + repo-watch remain before sign-off
3. 🔨 **Login overhaul (NEXT)** — login = Employee ID + admin-issued random password (admin-only reset); first login forces password change + optional TOTP 2FA with Skip; public sign-ups disabled; Edge Functions `provision-users` / `admin-reset-password` / login; optional "Link Google account" in Preferences; **default page after login = Calendar**. Full spec in PENDING_TASKS.md 🔐 section. **Prereqs (2026-06-13): install supabase CLI + `supabase login`/`link`; flip "Allow manual linking" ON.** Plan first (RSK-1, auth-wide). *(Replaces progressive-Google-linking; UNLINKED ACCOUNTS notification dropped.)*
4. ⏸ **R25 full RLS sweep** (on hold; resumes after overhaul) — core/M1 + M4/M5/M6 audits → `20260701_rls_with_check.sql` (incl. drafted `lr_update`/`fhs_update` WITH CHECK fixes from [AUDIT_2026-06-11_GOLIVE.md](AUDIT_2026-06-11_GOLIVE.md)) → client-role check → final anon probe
5. Closeout: template wording (user supplies text) · leave pro-rating decision · bilingual Help page (written after overhaul, documents the new login)
6. **Roster swap + go-live (LAST):** TRUNCATE CASCADE (RSK-0 — confirm), seed 14 real employees, sequence→15, Initialize Year ×6, provision real accounts, rotate OAuth client secret

**🟡 Pending logged-in spot-checks (R22/R23):** member self-role-change blocked · admin Projects stats load · Tags usage loads · employee REQUESTS shows only Employment Certificate.

**Standing actions before further testing:**
- After any new table migration, run `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';` in Supabase SQL Editor.
- Hard-refresh (Ctrl+F5) to load the latest JS (`?v=84` / `style.css?v=29` / `tokens.css?v=22`).
- **UI naming:** cite [UI_NAMING_REFERENCE.html](UI_NAMING_REFERENCE.html) for canonical element names; **update it whenever a page/section is added** (rule wired into the `app.html` add-page checklist).

> ⚠️ **Roster mismatch note:** The sci-fi demo roster does not reflect the real Hubble Engineering team composition (predominantly Mechanical Engineering). When going live, swap to the real roster (memory: `real-employee-roster.md`); department codes will need correcting then.

Legend: ✅ done · ⚠️ built with known bugs · 🔨 in progress · ⏸ deferred/parked · 📋 roadmap only

> **Auth sequencing decision (2026-06-06):** Phase 1 (auth overhaul) is deliberately last — all WMS modules are built against the current `is_admin()` guard. A single RLS reconciliation sweep applies the WMS 5-role matrix when the auth model is flipped before launch.
> **Revised 2026-06-12:** login method finalized — Employee ID + admin-issued password (admin-only reset), optional TOTP 2FA with first-login Skip, public sign-ups disabled, Google as optional linked identity. Build order: daily backup → login overhaul → R25 RLS sweep. Full spec in [PENDING_TASKS.md](PENDING_TASKS.md).

| `20260703_settlement_rpc.sql` | 2026-06-15 | M-SETTLE: atomic admin-only `approve_trip_settlement(uuid)` RPC — posts the correcting cash row + closes the trip in one transaction (replaces 2 client writes); idempotent + ICT-dated. ✅ Applied in Studio 2026-06-15; ⚠️ the v=95 frontend that calls it is **not yet pushed**. |
| `20260709_lint_search_path_and_execute_hardening.sql` | ✅ **2026-07-09 — applied + verified** | **L-FNSP + L-SPDEV** — closes the Supabase linter security WARNs. (1) 0011: pins `search_path` on 12 SECURITY INVOKER trigger/compute fns. (2) 0028: strips the default PUBLIC/`anon` EXECUTE grant on all 27 flagged SECURITY DEFINER fns; re-grants EXECUTE to `authenticated`+`service_role` on the 9 real RPCs + 10 RLS helpers, fully revokes the 8 trigger fns (also closes 0029 for those). Idempotent (name-keyed ALTER/REVOKE/GRANT). **Verified live** (plan task A1, R59): all 3 VERIFY queries run individually returned 0 rows — (2a) no fn missing a `search_path` pin, (2b) no SECURITY DEFINER fn anon-executable, (2c) the 8 trigger fns no longer grant EXECUTE to `authenticated`. Expected-residual 0029 WARNs on the 9 RPCs + 10 RLS helpers + 4 pn fns are **by design — do not re-flag.** 0032 leaked-password protection is a Dashboard toggle (no SQL) — deferred to plan task B4. |
| `20260712_client_block_expanded.sql` | ✅ **2026-07-09 — applied + verified** | **PR #26 salvage (R57)** — extends `20260708`'s RESTRICTIVE `client_block_*` to 12 missed internal tables (`employee_compensation` salary PII the worst miss; also `evaluations`, `employee_documents`, `employee_audit_log`, `leave_balances`, `flex_holiday_swaps`, jtcr/ncr/deletion requests, `travel_claims`, `project_assignments`, `groups`) + moves `audit_log_select_admin` from `get_my_role()` to `is_admin()`. Deny-only, idempotent, no wrapper. Renamed from the branch's `20260710_*` (date taken by Part Numbers). **Verified live** (plan task A0, R59): `SELECT ... FROM pg_policies WHERE policyname LIKE 'client_block_%'` returned all 12 new policies (plus the 11 from `20260708` + 6 pn-table ones, 29 total); `audit_log_select_admin.qual` confirmed `is_admin()`. **✅ Enforcement proven live**: `f01_prod_client_probe.ps1` re-run against a genuine `role='client'` login (Delos Incorporated) — **34 PASS / 0 FAIL**, all 12 newly-blocked tables (incl. `employee_compensation`) confirmed 0 rows for a client session. F-01-class gap fully closed. |
| `20260712b_f05_rpc_search_path.sql` | ✅ **2026-07-09 — applied + verified** | **PR #26 salvage (R57)** — pins `search_path = public, pg_temp` on the 3 F-05 request-review RPCs (pg_temp-shadowing defense-in-depth, matches `20260709`'s convention). Idempotent, no wrapper. Renamed from the branch's `20260711_*`. **Verified live** (plan task A0, R59): `proconfig` on all 3 RPCs (`approve_deletion_request`, `review_name_change_request`, `approve_job_title_change_request`) confirmed `search_path=public, pg_temp`. |
| `20260711_part_numbers_v2.sql` | 2026-07-08 | **PN v2 (spec-driven)** — `PART_NUMBERING_SPEC.md`: format `CC-PPP-AA-BBB`→`CCC-PPP-CAT-SEQ` (3-letter category, 11 governed seeds); retires `pn_projects` → uses real `projects`/`clients` (new 3-char `code` on each); `pn_attributes` (material/finish/vendor/fab_process/color); `pn_project_config`; revision `snapshot jsonb` (for Compare); rewritten `pn_create_item`/`pn_bump_revision` + `pn_item_snapshot`. ✅ Applied in prod Studio 2026-07-08 (11 letter codes verified; **no BEGIN/COMMIT wrapper on purpose** — the wrapped file ran only a fragment in the SQL Editor). Verified on scratch PG16 (v1→v2 transform + 12 behavioral/RLS tests). |
| `20260710_part_numbers.sql` | 2026-07-07 | **PN v1 — Part Number Generator** (`#part-numbers`): 5 tables (`pn_projects`, `pn_type_codes` seeded ×7, `pn_counters`, `pn_items`, `pn_item_revisions`) + RLS (internal roles; `client_block_*` RESTRICTIVE on all 5; `pn_items` has NO INSERT policy — RPC-only) + immutability guard trigger + RPCs `pn_create_item` (atomic counter, gap-free, numbers never reused) / `pn_bump_revision` / `pn_render_template`. ✅ Applied in prod Studio 2026-07-07 (7 type-code seeds verified). Note: applied via the autocommit variant — the `BEGIN…COMMIT`-wrapped file wouldn't run end-to-end in the SQL Editor (only a fragment executed, reporting "Success, no rows"). |

## What's built in Phase 3 — Employee DB (M3)

- Full employee record: personal, employment, compensation (encrypted-deferred), documents, skills
- Auto-computed Employee ID: `DD-T-NNN-CC` format, MOD 97-10 check digit, DB trigger
- Global number sequence (NNN, never reused); department lock for full-time
- Job title dropdown with predefined list + "Add new" option
- **Linked User Account UI** (Employment tab): admin links an employee record to a Google Auth account — required for employees to submit leave requests
- Status lifecycle: pending → active → resigned/terminated (archive, no delete)
- Manager tree: `direct_manager_id` self-referential FK; manager can see direct reports via updated RLS

**Demo roster:** 16 sci-fi employees, NNN 001–016, all active. Next hire: NNN 017.
See [HE_WMS_Specification.md §6.4](HE_WMS_Specification.md) for full roster.

## What's built in Phase 4 — Leave & Holiday (M2)

*(Current as-built tab structure after Rounds 2–4. `holidays.js` uses a 2-level tab architecture.)*

**Primary tabs:** `HOLIDAYS` · `MY LEAVE` · `TEAM LEAVE` (admin/mgr) · `POLICY`

- **HOLIDAYS** — year calendar + list view; multi-day clusters grouped ("13–15 Apr 2026"); Add / Edit (range modal) / Delete (whole cluster); 2026 Thai holidays seeded.
- **MY LEAVE** (secondary: Leave · **Flex** · My Balance)
  - *Leave* — submit own request (Full day / Half day; cross-pool Annual↔Personal; document path) + own history (past hidden by default).
  - *Flex* — sub-tabs **Flex Swap** (waive a holiday → weekday substitute) and **Work From Home** (standalone, no holiday waived); unified history.
  - *My Balance* — own balances with synthetic policy-default fallback.
- **TEAM LEAVE** (admin/mgr; secondary: Team Leave · Team Flex · Approvals · Team Balance)
  - Employee picker is a native `<input list>`+`<datalist>` autocomplete.
  - *Approvals* sub-views: **PENDING** / **SCHEDULE** / **HISTORY** (override any status + notes). Manager sees direct reports only (`is_manager_of()` RLS).
- **POLICY** — read-only leave-policy document (entitlements, advance-notice rules, per-type sections) sourced from `leave_types`.

**Leave types:** Annual 12 / Personal 6 / Sick 30 / Maternity 98 / **Court Leave** (pools → personal) / Flex Holiday. Paternity **deactivated** (not in policy v1.0). `used_days` auto-deducts on approval (trigger).

**Notifications page** (`requests.js`, in WMS nav): all users see own leave requests + 3-day dismissable cards for resolved requests; admin sees deletion / name-change / job-title-change queues with approve/reject + nav badge.

**Modals:** Profile + Preferences are **read-only**; name and job-title changes go through the request flow.

## ⚠️ Known issues / pending before next phase

| # | Priority | Issue | Fix |
|---|----------|-------|-----|
| ✅ P-1 | — | Test employee linked (B-01, David Bowman NNN 003) | Done + tested |
| P-2 | 🟡 | Sci-fi demo roster dept codes don't match real team (mostly Mechanical) | At go-live, swap to real roster from `real-employee-roster.md` memory |
| ✅ P-3 | — | `util/employeeId.js` dead code | Removed (P-01) |
| ✅ P-4 | — | Deletion-request approval UI | Built — now the Notifications page |
| ✅ P-5 | — | `used_days` not auto-deducted on approval | Trigger `trg_sync_leave_balance` (`20260608_*`) |
| ✅ R5-01 | — | "Profile modal not centered" — was actually the **avatar dropdown menu** | Centered `.avatar-dropdown` in the nav panel (`left:50%`); profileModal edits reverted |
| ✅ R5-02 | — | Team selectors need a clear "✕" | Overlaid `.emp-clear-btn` added to all 3 pickers |
| ✅ R5-03 | — | Notifications per-card dismiss "✕" + admin coverage | Dismiss → ✕ icon; admins now also get the dismissable cards |
| ✅ R5-04 | — | Leave/flex date pickers allowed weekends | `_wireWeekendBlock` + submit guards; defaults snap to next weekday |
| ✅ R5-05 | — | Notifications page not tabbed | Tabs: Deletion · Profile Changes (name+job-title) · Leave Requests |
| ✅ R5-06 | — | No shared UI vocabulary (the R5-01 mix-up) | Built `UI_NAMING_REFERENCE.html` (tabbed, searchable, layout maps) |
